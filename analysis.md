# Wallet Credit Score Analysis

This document presents an analysis of credit scores generated for wallets based on their DeFi transaction behavior. The credit scores range from 0 to 1000, where:

- **Higher scores** indicate trustworthy, stable, and responsible wallet behavior.
- **Lower scores** highlight risky, bot-like, or exploitative patterns.

##  Behavioral Insights by Score Range

###  0–200 (High Risk)

- **Behavior:** These wallets typically show erratic or extremely short-lived activity. Indicators include:
  - Very low total transaction count
  - Abnormally high borrow without corresponding repayment
  - A low redeem/repay ratio
  - Low active days or usage bursts
- **Inference:** Likely bots, exploiters, or throwaway wallets.

---

###  201–500 (Moderate Risk)

- **Behavior:** Inconsistent usage patterns:
  - Few deposits compared to withdrawals
  - Occasional repayments but below average ratios
  - Limited active days and liquidity interactions
- **Inference:** These wallets may belong to occasional users or testing wallets. They show some utility, but reliability is questionable.

---

###  501–800 (Low Risk)

- **Behavior:** These wallets maintain stable and balanced interactions:
  - Reasonable number of transactions
  - Positive repay/redeem ratios
  - Active over multiple days or months
- **Inference:** Possibly real users with fair engagement in DeFi protocols.

---

### 801–1000 (Very Low Risk / Trusted)

- **Behavior:**
  - High and consistent transaction volumes
  - Good repay and redeem behavior
  - Long active durations
  - Low or zero liquidation history
- **Inference:** Strong indication of responsible wallet usage. Could be long-term investors or experienced DeFi users.

##  Conclusion

The scoring system provides a clear separation between high-risk and trustworthy wallets based on on-chain behavior patterns. It can be extended with:

- More granular features (e.g., protocol-specific metrics)
- Time series behavior trends
- Integration with risk labels (fraudulent/exploiter tagging)
